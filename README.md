# Obsidian Dataview Serializer

Obsidian plugin that gives you the power of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), but generates Markdown. Thanks to this, the output of your queries is saved in the notes, and the links actually appear on the Graph, making it even more useful.
Turning Dataview queries into Markdown also ensures that the generated content appears on Obsidian Publish websites, which is not the case with the Dataview plugin.
